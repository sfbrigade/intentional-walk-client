# Let's Walk

**Track your steps and compete for prizes**

A free and easy-to-use mobile application as part of the Let's Walk Program, which will help participants stay motivated by tracking their steps while offering SF Giants swag as prize incentives.

Let's Walk is a program run by the San Francisco Department of Public Health, in partnership California Department of Public Health, SF Recreation and Parks Department, and the San Francisco Giants, to encourage San Francisco residents who are eligible for CalFresh/MediCal benefits to increase physical activity and develop healthy habits.

Let's Walk is an open source application developed by SF Civic Tech volunteers, a Code for America brigade.
