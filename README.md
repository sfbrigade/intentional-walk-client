# Intentional Walk

This is the new Intentional Walk iOS and Android client app codebase.

# Deploying Releases

## Step 1: Set up necessary credentials

Contact another developer or admin on this project and:

* Share the email address associated with an Apple ID that you will use to log in to the Apple Developer Program website. You will be invited to the developer team.

  * In the `ios` directory, copy `example.env` to `.env` and set the email address associated with your Apple ID registered with the Apple Developer Program.

  * Once you accept the invite, log in to the [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/) website to download and install Xcode. 

* Share the email address associated with a Google Account that you will use to log in to the Google Play Console. You will then get the files and password to do the following:

  * In the `android` directory, copy `example.env` to `.env` and set the password for the production signing keystore.

  * In the `android` directory, save a copy of the `intentional-walk-upload-key.keystore` production signing keystore.

  * In the `android/fastlane` directory, save a copy of the `key.json` for the Google Play service account used to automate release uploads.

## Step 2: Set up command-line tools

* In the root of the project, run `bundle` to install the deployment tools.

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
